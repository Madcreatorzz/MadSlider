Portable Slider for photography and videography

Board built around a Raspberry Pi Zero W. It will allow to receive commands from a smartphone with bluetooth (serial) and also control mirrorless camera (like lumix G9) via wifi. 

The slider can handle smooth move for video or timelapse with tiny steps at a time.
